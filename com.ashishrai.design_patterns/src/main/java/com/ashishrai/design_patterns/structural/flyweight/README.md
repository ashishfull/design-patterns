# Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. It enables you to create a tree-like structure of objects, where individual objects and composite objects (composed of other objects) can be treated in the same way.

## 🛠️ Why Composite Pattern?
➡️ Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
➡️ Create tree structures representing complex hierarchical systems.
➡️ Simplify the code by managing individual objects and compositions through a single interface.

## 👥 Use Cases
🏞️ Representing files and directories in a file system.
🔗 Building a UI menu with nested submenus.
📁 Organizing employees in a corporate hierarchy.
🏢 Representing department structures within an organization.
🌳 Managing complex objects like trees in a forest or inventory systems.

## ✅ Benefits
🛠️ Improved flexibility in handling individual objects and compositions.
🛠️ Easier to manage and maintain hierarchical structures.
🛠️ Code becomes more readable and easier to understand.

## ❌ Drawbacks
🔍 Overhead in maintaining complex hierarchical structures.
📉 Performance overhead when dealing with large compositions.

## 🛠️ Example Implementation
The Composite Design Pattern can be effectively applied in various scenarios. In our code, we use the pattern to manage tree types and forest structures uniformly. This approach enables efficient reuse of tree types and allows for easy management of different tree instances in a forest.

By utilizing the Composite Design Pattern, you can make your system more user-friendly, maintainable, and scalable.

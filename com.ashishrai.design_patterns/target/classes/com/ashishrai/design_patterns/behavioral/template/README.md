# 🛠️ Template Method Pattern  

The **Template Method Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that defines the **skeleton** of an algorithm in a superclass. It lets subclasses redefine specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure.  

## 🌟 Key Features  
- **Reusability:** Abstracts common logic into a base class.  
- **Flexibility:** Allows subclasses to implement custom behavior for specific steps.  
- **Control:** Ensures the algorithm follows a defined sequence.  

## 📝 Use Case: Order Processing System  

Imagine an **Order Processing System** where multiple order types (Online, In-Store, etc.) follow similar steps:  
1. **Select Products**  
2. **Process Payment**  
3. **Deliver the Order**  

While the steps are the same, the way each step is implemented can vary. For instance, delivery for online orders might involve shipping, whereas in-store orders might simply involve handing the product to the customer.  

The Template Method Pattern helps by defining the overall structure in a base class while allowing the subclasses to provide their specific implementations for steps like payment and delivery.  

## 🎯 Why Use This Pattern?  
- Standardizes the algorithm structure.  
- Encourages code reuse and reduces duplication.  
- Simplifies maintenance by isolating variable parts in subclasses.  

## 🚀 Where Can It Be Applied?  
- Order processing systems  
- Data parsing and report generation workflows  
- Game AI strategies  
- Cooking recipe instructions  

## ✅ Advantages  
- Ensures consistent behavior across subclasses.  
- Promotes code reuse.  
- Makes the overall algorithm easier to understand and maintain.  

## ⚡ Limitations  
- Requires careful planning to avoid rigid structures.  
- Subclassing can lead to complexity if overused.  

By implementing the Template Method Pattern, you can ensure a consistent and modular approach to workflows that follow a standard sequence!

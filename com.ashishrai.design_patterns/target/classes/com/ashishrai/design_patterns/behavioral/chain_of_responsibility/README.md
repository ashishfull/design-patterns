# 🧩 Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility (CoR) is a **behavioral design pattern** that allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers until it is processed. Each handler in the chain either processes the request or passes it to the next handler.

---

## ✨ Key Features of the CoR Pattern

- **Decoupled Responsibility**: The sender of a request doesn't need to know which handler will process it.
- **Flexible Chains**: Handlers can be dynamically rearranged or extended at runtime.
- **Avoids Monolithic Classes**: Breaks down responsibilities into smaller, reusable units.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. A **client** sends a request to the first handler in the chain.
2. Each **handler** decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler.
3. The process continues until a handler processes the request or the chain ends.

## 💻 Example: Helpdesk Ticket Handling

In our **helpdesk system**, different levels of support (e.g., Basic Support, Intermediate Support, Advanced Support) handle issues:

- **Basic Support** handles general queries like password resets.  
- **Intermediate Support** manages slightly technical issues like configuration errors.  
- **Advanced Support** deals with complex issues like system outages.

Using the CoR pattern:
- **A ticket is passed through the chain** of support levels.  
- Each level decides whether to handle the ticket or pass it to the next level.

## 🔍 Benefits of the CoR Pattern

- 🚀 **Decoupling**: Separates request sender from the receiver.  
- 🔄 **Reusability**: Handlers can be reused across different chains.  
- ⚡ **Dynamic Behavior**: The chain can be modified at runtime.

---

## ⚡ Challenges

- 🧩 The request may go unhandled if no handler in the chain processes it.
- 🔧 Debugging can become tricky in long chains with many handlers.

---

## 🌟 Real-World Applications

- **Support Systems**: Handling customer queries at different support levels.
- **Middleware in Web Servers**: Intercepting and processing HTTP requests.
- **Event Bubbling**: In UI frameworks like JavaScript, events pass through elements in a DOM hierarchy.

## 📝 Examples We Implemented

1. **Helpdesk Ticket System**: 
   - Requests for support were passed through different levels (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced). 
   - Each level decided whether to process the ticket or pass it on.

2. **Customizable Chains**: 
   - We demonstrated how to dynamically rearrange handlers in the chain.  
   - Ensured that if no handler processes the request, a **"Fallback Handler"** gracefully manages it.

By leveraging the **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**, you can create systems that are modular, flexible, and scalable! 🚀

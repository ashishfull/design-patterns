# 🎭 Interpreter Design Pattern - Simplifying Complex Grammars!

## 🧐 What is the Interpreter Pattern?
The Interpreter Pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that defines a way to interpret or evaluate a grammar or expression. It uses a set of classes to represent various rules and interprets them based on the provided context.

---

## 🛠️ How Does It Work?
- Defines a **grammar** for a language.
- Implements an **interpreter** to process and evaluate the expressions based on the grammar.
- Can be used to evaluate complex expressions step by step in a structured way.

---

## ✨ Example: Roman Numeral Converter
We implemented a **Roman Numeral Interpreter**:
- Converts Roman numerals like `MCMXCIV` into integers.
- Processes rules dynamically, starting from the largest Roman numeral (e.g., `M`) to the smallest (e.g., `I`).

### 💡 Why This Example?
Roman numerals follow a strict grammar. By interpreting symbols (`M`, `CM`, `D`, etc.) and applying specific rules (like subtraction for `IV` or `CM`), we simplify the problem into a structured solution.

---

## ✅ Key Highlights
1️⃣ **Dynamic Rule Evaluation**: Handles Roman numeral grammar efficiently by evaluating the largest rules first.  
2️⃣ **Extensibility**: Add new rules (e.g., custom numeral systems) with minimal changes.  
3️⃣ **Error Handling**: Detects and handles invalid Roman numeral sequences gracefully.

## 🌟 Advantages
- Simplifies parsing and evaluation of complex grammars.
- Promotes a modular and reusable structure.

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Not suitable for highly complex grammars.
- Can become hard to manage with too many rules.

## 🚀 Usage in Real-World Scenarios
- Converting Roman numerals to integers.
- SQL-like query interpreters.
- Mathematical expression evaluation engines.
- Language parsers or compilers.

# Visitor Design Pattern üìê

## Introduction
The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows us to add new operations to existing class hierarchies without modifying their structure. It achieves this by separating the operations (visitors) from the object structure on which they operate.

In this implementation, we demonstrate the Visitor Pattern with shapes and operations like **area calculation** and **scaling**.

## Key Concepts üß†

- **Visitor Interface**: Defines methods to visit each type of element in the object structure.
- **Concrete Visitors**: Implement the operations to be performed on the elements.
- **Element Interface**: Represents objects that accept visitors.
- **Concrete Elements**: Implement the `accept` method to allow visitors to operate on them.
- **Client**: Drives the process by passing visitors to the elements.

## Example Overview üìä

### Context
We have different shapes like `Circle` and `Rectangle`, and we want to perform multiple operations such as calculating the area, scaling, and visualizing the shapes.

### Components
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Shapes**: Represent the elements (`Circle` and `Rectangle`) on which operations are performed.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Visitors**: Represent the operations:
   - `AreaCalculator`: Calculates the area of shapes.
   - `ScaleShape`: Scales shapes by a given factor.
   - `DrawShape`: Prints a graphical representation of the shape.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Client Code**: Demonstrates the Visitor Pattern by performing all the operations on the shapes.

## Flow üöÄ

1. Define different shapes implementing the `accept` method to interact with visitors.
2. Implement specific operations (visitors) such as area calculation, scaling, and drawing.
3. Use the client code to iterate through shapes and perform the operations sequentially by invoking their `accept` methods.

---

## Advantages ‚úÖ
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Add new operations without altering existing shapes.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the operations and data structure independent.
- **Extensibility**: Makes it easy to introduce new visitors.

---

## Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Rigid for New Elements**: Adding new shapes requires changes in all visitor implementations.
- **Complexity**: May add unnecessary complexity for simple use cases.

---

## Real-World Applications üåç
- **Compilers**: Abstract Syntax Tree traversal for code analysis.
- **Graphic Editors**: Operations like resizing, color adjustments, and rendering on shapes.
- **Banking Systems**: Performing different operations on transactions or accounts based on their type.

---

## Example in Action üéâ
**Scenario**:  
We have shapes like `Circle` and `Rectangle`. The client performs the following operations sequentially:
1. Draw the shape.
2. Calculate its area.
3. Scale the shape by a factor of `3`.
4. Recalculate the area.

# üåü Proxy Design Pattern

The **Proxy Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object. It acts as an intermediary, offering additional functionality such as lazy initialization, access control, or logging, while maintaining the same interface as the real object.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why Proxy Pattern?

‚û°Ô∏è Controls access to expensive or sensitive resources.  
‚û°Ô∏è Adds extra functionality (like logging or caching) without modifying the real object.  
‚û°Ô∏è Improves performance by deferring object creation or resource-heavy operations until absolutely necessary.  

---

## üë∑ Where Can It Be Applied?

‚û°Ô∏è **Virtual Proxy:** Manages heavy objects by creating them only when required, like image or video loading in applications.  
‚û°Ô∏è **Protection Proxy:** Controls access to methods based on permissions or roles, such as restricting sensitive operations.  
‚û°Ô∏è **Remote Proxy:** Represents objects in remote locations, often used in distributed systems.  
‚û°Ô∏è **Smart Proxy:** Adds functionality like logging, reference counting, or caching to an object.

---

## ‚úÖ What Makes It Special?

‚û°Ô∏è Enables lazy initialization to improve performance.  
‚û°Ô∏è Enhances security by restricting direct access to sensitive objects.  
‚û°Ô∏è Provides flexibility to extend object behavior without changing its implementation.  
‚û°Ô∏è Supports distributed object systems by representing remote objects locally.

## üí° Code Example: Video Streaming Service  

In our example:  
- The **Subject (Video)** defines the interface with a `play()` method.  
- The **Real Subject (RealVideo)** handles the heavy operation of loading and playing the video.  
- The **Proxy (VideoProxy)** acts as a stand-in, delegating to `RealVideo` only when necessary.

### **Explanation of Code**

1. When the client requests to play a video for the first time, the proxy creates the `RealVideo` object and loads the video. This represents **lazy initialization**.  
2. On subsequent requests for the same video, the proxy directly calls the `play()` method of the already initialized `RealVideo` object, avoiding redundant loading operations.  
3. This ensures efficient resource utilization, especially for operations like video or image loading, where immediate access to all data is unnecessary.

## üìà Advantages and Disadvantages  

### üöÄ Advantages:  
‚û°Ô∏è Reduces resource usage by initializing objects only when needed.  
‚û°Ô∏è Adds functionality like logging, caching, and access control without modifying the real object.  
‚û°Ô∏è Enhances security and encapsulation by limiting direct access to the real object.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages:  
‚û°Ô∏è Increases complexity with an additional layer of abstraction.  
‚û°Ô∏è Overhead in memory and processing due to the proxy object.

## üîç Real-World Analogies  

‚û°Ô∏è **ATM Machines:** The ATM acts as a proxy for your bank account. You interact with the ATM to withdraw cash, but the actual account operations are performed on the bank's backend systems.  
‚û°Ô∏è **Video Streaming Services:** Platforms like YouTube use proxy-like mechanisms to load video content gradually as required, avoiding preloading the entire video.

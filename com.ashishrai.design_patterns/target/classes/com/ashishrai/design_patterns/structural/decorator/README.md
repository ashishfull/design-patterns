# üçï Decorator Design Pattern - Pizza Customization Example

The **Decorator Design Pattern** allows for dynamically adding or modifying the behavior of an object without altering its structure. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why Decorator Pattern?

‚û°Ô∏è Enhance object functionality dynamically.  
‚û°Ô∏è Follow the Open/Closed Principle.  
‚û°Ô∏è Avoid subclassing for every new feature.  
‚û°Ô∏è Enable feature combinations with minimal code changes.  

---

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works?

1. Define a **Component Interface** to outline the core functionalities.  
2. Implement a **Concrete Component** that provides the default implementation.  
3. Create an **Abstract Decorator** class that implements the same interface and includes a reference to the component.  
4. Develop **Concrete Decorators** to add new behaviors by overriding methods.

## üë∑ Where Can It Be Applied?

‚û°Ô∏è Adding features to a UI element like buttons, scroll bars, or text boxes.  
‚û°Ô∏è Enabling middleware in HTTP requests/responses.  
‚û°Ô∏è Logging, encryption, or compression of data streams.  
‚û°Ô∏è Extending functionalities in gaming objects like character abilities or weapons.  

---

## ‚úÖ Pros  

‚û°Ô∏è Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.  
‚û°Ô∏è Promotes flexibility and code reusability.  
‚û°Ô∏è Avoids subclass explosion by eliminating the need to create a new subclass for every feature.  

---

## ‚ùå Cons  

‚û°Ô∏è Can lead to complexity when multiple decorators are stacked.  
‚û°Ô∏è Debugging and tracing can become challenging due to many layers.

## üåü Key Takeaway  

By utilizing the Decorator Design Pattern, you can create flexible and maintainable solutions for dynamically adding new features to objects without modifying their original code.
